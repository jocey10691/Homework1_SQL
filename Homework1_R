#Homework 1 

#1.Write a loop that calculates factorials up to 12
#Wasn't sure how to get it to calculate from scratch, so used the built-in factorial option

for (i in 1:12)
{
  print (factorial(i))
}

#2.Create a numeric vector that contains the sequence from 20 to 50 by 5
# Source: http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/seq.php 

Vector<- seq(from=20, to=50, by=5)

#3. Fitting numbers into the Quadratic Formula

#Quadratic Equation= ax^2+bx+c=0
#Use the Quadractic Formula to determine the roots 
#first separate out the discriminant to see if it is positive, equal to zero, or negative

roots <- function(a,b,c){
  if(discriminant(a,b,c) > 0){
    first_root = (-b+sqrt(discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a)
     second_root = (-b-sqrt(discriminant(a,b,c)))/(2*a)
    roots = c(first_root,second_root)
  }
  else if(discriminant(a,b,c) == 0){ #D=0
    roots = -b/(2*a)
  }
  else {"The roots are imaginary"} # D<0
}

# Discriminant Formula
discriminant<-function(a,b,c){
  b^2-4*a*c
}
#Test Case leads to the roots are imaginary 
a<-roots(4,-2,1);a
